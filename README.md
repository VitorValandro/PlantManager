## ðŸ“ƒ About the project

Plant Manager is an application that reminds people to water their plants and take care of them. Based on an json API, the user can select different types of plants with specific
features as watering frequency, description and tips to keep them healthy, in addition to the home environment where it is. When it comes time to water for a specific plant, the application issues an alert.

It was developed as a study at Next Level Week 5, provided by Rocketseat. I've learned a lot of React Native advanced techniques.
